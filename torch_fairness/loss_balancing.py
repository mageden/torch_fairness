These are all complicated and will take time to setup, so putting on hold for now.

    Best way to test it is working would be to:
    - simulate data for two continuous objectives, y1 and y2, and train model on them.
    - Change scale for one, y1=y1*3, then retrain w/o gradnorm and with gradnorm
    - Performance w/ gradnrom and scaled should be the same as the unscaled if it works properly
